## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Conventions

When using AI-assisted development tools, use these prefixes:
- `claude/` - Claude Code branches (e.g., `claude/add-feature`)
- `codexc/` - OpenAI Codex CLI branches
- `codexw/` - Codex Web branches
- `aider/` - Aider branches
- `main` - Production branch (protected)

### Setting Up Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bodal.dev.git
   cd bodal.dev
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b claude/your-feature-name
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Type checking (must pass before committing)
bun run typecheck

# Linting
bun run lint

# Build for production
bun run build
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enforced
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Ensure responsive design works on all devices

## Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat: add dark mode toggle to navigation

docs: update README with deployment instructions
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass and code type checks
